# WelcomeðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I am Fuka Nagata, majoring CS in Langara college. In this project, I made my first deployed personal website! I recently started learning React, so that I used React to develop this website. I will update this website as I learn more about front-end programming to use as my resume.

## Website
